# SD-WAN Experiment

[Software Defined WAN](http://sdwan.freertr.org/), on RARE/freeRtr, is the easily diagnosticable mesh for ipv4 and ipv6 networks to stay current and connected.

## Overview
A [software-defined wide area network](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-a-sd-wan) (SD-WAN) is a virtualized service that connects and extends enterprise networks over large geographical distances. WANs use links such as multiprotocol label switching (MPLS), wireless, broadband, virtual private networks (VPNs) and the internet to give users in remote offices access to corporate applications, services and resources, allowing them to work regardless of location. SD-WAN monitors the performance of WAN connections and manages traffic in an effort to maintain high speeds and optimize connectivity.
